Had to make a zip, since paths of backup-GPOs reaches the maximum path length 
on Windows systems of 256 chars (or whatever it is). We may only pray that within 
2050, Microsoft will have developed technology that copes with those long paths, 
allthough such super-advanced technology will probably require Azure - until then, 
we zip.
