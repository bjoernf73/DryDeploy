# dry.module.core

This module contains core components of DryDeploy. 

Separation of classes into separate ps1-files have been tried, but circular class dependencies seems to make it impossible to do. Probably an easy fix, however, for now, all classes are in the psm1. In time, all functions should disappear, and become methods in the classes. Just for fun. For now, it works.
